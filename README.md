## Portfolio

## Purpose

A website built to view a potenital employee's deloplyed portfolio of work samples
So that a potential employer can review samples of their work and assess whether they are a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

Given I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
When I load their portfolio
Then I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
When I click one of the links in the navigation
Then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
When I click on the link to the section about their work
Then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
When I am presented with the developer's first application
Then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
When I click on the images of the applications
Then I am taken to that deployed application
When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
Then I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
